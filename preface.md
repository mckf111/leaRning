> I would like to post a series recording my way of learning R language, with the name "leaRning"! **Repost by indicating the source please!**

## Why I learn R

Because I swithed my major to bioinformatics in which data manipulation is the core, on the other hand, the [R programming language](https://cran.r-project.org/) is irreplaceable now for data science, so learning R is a necessity and must! What's more, it would be much easier learning other programming languages after you conquer one.




## My background

I am a purely "wet" biologist, when I was a freshman in college **14 years ago**, there was a course teaching C++, actually, I have a solid foundation on programming, *if I had an unfaded memory...*

In 2017, I have made up my mind to switch my major, firstly, I wanna be a coder directly, so I took several months learning frontend, python, java, etc. However, I found I could never get interested in any of them! **Fortunately, I got to know some commons among different programming languages during that struggle!**

Half a year ago, I entered bioinformatics, still get entertained now~

## My learning progress

ING, the book I use now is [The Art of R Programming](http://diytranscriptomics.com/Reading/files/The%20Art%20of%20R%20Programming.pdf), I think it is better for beginners than *R in Action*, because you need much more knowledge on statistics when reading the latter and this may cause you distracted!

## My target

I want to **publish** an R package on my own in 2018!
